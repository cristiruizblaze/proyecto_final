@misc{Raya-Baron2019,
abstract = {This review is focused on iron-based homogeneous catalytic systems described so far for the reduction of carbonyl compounds (ketones and aldehydes) into alcohols via hydrosilylation. It begins by explaining the basic concepts of the hydrosilylation reaction, addressing its main advantages and procedural differences with other common reduction methods, and highlighting the interest for its use in organic chemistry. Then, the advances in the development of iron-based catalysts, as a more sustainable alternative to the traditional noble-metal catalysts, that have taken place to date are reviewed in depth. The revision of the different types of catalysts is followed by a profound discussion of the mechanistic proposals found in the literature.},

abstract = {A well-defined lithiated hydrazone derivative has been synthesized and fully characterized through various analytical platforms, including multinuclear (1H, 13C, 15N, 7Li) and two-dimensional NMR, high-resolution MS spectrometry, IR, and X-ray diffraction crystallography. It behaves as a binuclear species in the solid state and as a monomeric contact ion pair in solution. It has also been tested as a catalyst in hydrosilylation reactions, being the first lithium hydrazone reported to catalyze the full conversion of carbonyls of different nature into alcohols in short reaction times, at room temperature, and with catalyst loadings equal to or below 0.5 mol {\%}. Kinetic studies have proven fractional order dependences with respect to ketone and silane and first order dependence in the case of the catalyst. The proposed reaction mechanism is characterized by the nucleophilic addition of the lithium hydrazonide to the silicon atom of the silane to give a five-coordinate silicon species.},

abstract = {Simple bases (KOtBu, KOH) catalyze the silane-promoted reduction of ketones and esters to alcohols and of aldimines to amines. The inexpensive silane PMHS (polymethylhydrosiloxane) can be used as the reducing reagent. Double and triple bonds, as well as nitro- and cyano-groups are tolerated. Careful dosing of the silane allows for chemoselective reduction of a more reactive group in the presence of a less reactive group (for example, aldehyde reduction in the presence of ketone/ketone reduction in the presence of ester group). Mechanistic studies showed that addition of base to silanes leads to silicate species, which are the acting reducing agents. Under basic conditions, hydrosiloxanes (tetramethyldisiloxane, TMDS; PMHS) convert into simple silanes (H 2SiMe2, H3SiMe), making this a practical method to generate these challenging silanes.
